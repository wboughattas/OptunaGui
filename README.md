# OptunaGui

## Challenge

This README has been generated by an LLM and outlines the long-term objectives set for this project.

## Introduction

A low-code hyperparameter tuning tool with a focus on setup flexibility, visualizations and comparisons, experiment
management, and real-time insights. These are the features:

### Interactive Experiment Setup

- Guided Experiment Initialization: A wizard-like UI that guides users through setting up an experiment, including model
  selection, hyperparameter ranges, dataset selection, and splitting methods.
- Feature Selection and Engineering: Allow users to toggle features on/off and apply basic transformations directly in
  the UI (e.g., normalization, encoding) to see how they impact the model’s performance.
- Predefined Parameter Presets: Provide commonly used hyperparameter presets for different models (e.g., LightGBM,
  XGBoost) that users can select as a starting point, with options to adjust if desired.

### Flexible Run and Trial Management

- Run Configuration Cloning: Enable users to clone an existing run configuration to create a new run, allowing them
  to tweak only a few parameters and compare results.
- Real-time Trial Insights: Show trial metrics and hyperparameters being tested in real time, so users can watch how
  different settings affect performance metrics as Optuna runs.
- Early Stopping and Trial Adjustment: Give users the ability to pause or stop trials, adjust parameter ranges
  mid-run, or apply early stopping if performance doesn’t improve.

### Experiment Comparison and Analysis

- Comparison Dashboard: Display the results of multiple runs side-by-side, with options to compare key metrics (e.g.,
  accuracy, AUC, F1) and hyperparameters of each best-performing trial.
- Feature Impact Analysis: Show feature importance or SHAP values to help users understand the impact of each
  feature
  in the model. Include an easy way to toggle new features and re-run experiments to see if they improve
  performance.
- Statistical Comparison Tool: Offer statistical tests (e.g., t-test, paired comparison) for users to verify if
  differences between runs are statistically significant.

### Automated Reporting and Documentation

- Auto-Generated Reports: Provide auto-generated summaries for each run, including the best hyperparameters, model
  performance metrics, and feature importance, allowing users to download reports or generate visualizations.
- Experiment Notes and Logging: Let users add custom notes to each experiment, allowing them to document insights,
  assumptions, and potential future adjustments directly within the UI.
- Session Replay for Experiments: Log the settings of each experiment so users can replay or review their exact
  steps, settings, and parameter ranges in a previous run, making it easy to replicate or refine past experiments.

### Real-Time Visualization and Feedback

- Progress Visualization: Show real-time visual feedback for optimization progress, including convergence plots,
  hyperparameter value exploration, and a summary of the best score so far.
- Metric Threshold Alerts: Allow users to set custom alerts (e.g., “Notify if AUC > 0.9”) that pop up when a trial
  reaches or exceeds a specific threshold.
- Parameter Space Visualization: Visualize the hyperparameter space (e.g., scatter plots for two hyperparameters) to
  help users understand how Optuna is exploring and exploiting the parameter space.

### Data and Model Versioning

- Dataset and Model Version Control: Track versions of datasets and models used in each experiment, allowing users
  to
  revert to previous versions easily and ensure consistency in results.
- Pipeline Logging: Keep logs of the complete ML pipeline (e.g., feature engineering, transformations, model
  parameters) used in each experiment to make sure results are reproducible and understandable.

### Quick Experimenting Features

- One-Click Re-Run with Changes: Enable users to make small adjustments (e.g., add/remove a feature) and re-run the
  experiment with a single click to quickly test the impact.
- Snapshot Comparison: Allow users to “snapshot” a run’s results and settings, making it easy to compare the impact
  of new features or changes against this baseline.
- Quick Parameter Tuning Mode: Offer a “quick tuning” mode for rapid testing, where only a few trials run to give
  users a rough idea of a new feature’s impact without waiting for a full optimization.

### Integration and Export Options

- Export Best Model: Provide an easy way to export the best model configuration and parameters from any run for
  deployment or further experimentation.
- API Access for Automation: Allow users to access the tool’s functionality via API, enabling them to automate
  experiment runs and fetch results programmatically.
- Model Deployment Ready Export: Package the best model with its hyperparameters and preprocessing steps into a
  format ready for deployment, ensuring consistency from experimentation to production.

### User Access and Collaboration

- Collaborative Experimentation: Allow multiple users to view or contribute to the same experiment, with permissions
  and sharing capabilities.
- Result Sharing and Comparison Across Teams: Enable users to share results with teammates or export interactive
  plots and summaries for team discussions.

### Smart Recommendations

- Hyperparameter Suggestions: Based on historical performance, suggest starting ranges or values for hyperparameters
  likely to yield better results.
- Automated Feature Selection Recommendations: Highlight features that may not contribute significantly to the
  model’s performance, allowing users to reduce feature set size.
- Run Similarity Analysis: Analyze and recommend similar experiments, alerting users if they’re testing
  configurations similar to previous ones and providing suggestions for novel exploration paths.
